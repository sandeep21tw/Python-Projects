This program is a simple email validator which checks whether the input given by user is valid or not.


Things for a valid mail:
- it shouldn't start with a number and (dot)
- it must have only @ symbol (used to denote the name of service provider after @)
- it len must be greater than 6 (why? because shortest email could be a@b.com, whose length is 7)
- after @ there should be only one dot (.) [after (.) name of the high level domain comes)
- left side (before @) shouldn't contain any character other than (a-z), (0-9) and (.)

i think that is it!	



- it shouldn't be uppercase technically but we could handle that by just converting it to lowercase automatically when creating (or evaluating)
